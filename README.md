## Jobot cloned with Sveltekit
This is my portfolio for Jobot. Hopefully they hire me!

### What's new?
- ⭐️ All job pages are SEO optimized! You can expect organic visitors via Google search!
- ⭐️ The new design intuitively appeals to users with the strength of AI technology.
- ⭐️ This clone-app uses the real-time data from web scraping. You can actually apply for the jobs!
- ⭐️ You can bookmark your favorite jobs. The cached data is saved in your local storage.

### Things I did not implement
- autocompletion: Due to web scraping of the original data, autocomplete may cause a DDoS attack on the other server. Therefore, this feature is not implemented.
- auth, notification-email, relational database, payment flow: The listed features are not implemented since there is no intention to steal their users.
